# Hangout Client



# Hangout App Client dev process

We created an app that allows users to create events called 'Hangs'. As a signed in user you can set when, where, and what the event is.You can also RSVP (future update) to events and keep track of which events you are going to.

## Deployed sites

Front end (https://fbrd2.github.io/hangout-client/).
Back end (https://shrouded-refuge-81940.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting Started

Fork can be made and grunt served onto your server from the link to the project here (https://github.com/FBRD2/hangout-client)

### Future fixes/issues

- Need a RSVP
